// Submission for Week 3 : password_Generator

// My goals included:
 Creating a functional password generator that incorporates uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters.  I designed the code wit the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

This project, was exceptionally difficult for me using JavaScript in general. I searched many pages and ultimately found that there seem to be infinite ways this assignment could have been completed. In general, I generally opt for doing most anything in the simplest fashion, however, I managed to confuse myself several times during this process. Ultimately, I am more intrigued and even slightly more confident now. I believed the process of searching for information on my own combined with the help of the TAâ€™s, instructor, and classmates, I have reached a more complete understanding of JavaScript in general. That said, I am aware I have a long way to go. 

I am proud to say that with help, I was able to complete this assignment and watch it work. I believe I was able to create a functional password generator that meets the criteria using JavaScript. I found this process challenging but also highly satisfying. I enjoy the feeling of working under pressure and taking on challenges that are well beyond my scope and skill set. Still, I look forward to the next project as well as continuing the learning process and sharpening my skills overall.  


As I have mentioned, I am becoming more obsessed with coding and the challenge it presents. I love the sense that I can imagine something and breathe life into it with code. I look forward to new ideas, projects, and challenges. This experience so far has been eye-opening certainly and continues to pique my interests and expectations.
